# Fluid Simulation

This is an implementation of a simple 2D fluid simulation based on Mike Ash's "Fluid Simulation for Dummies" (https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html).

I used:
- OpenGL as the graphics API.
- Glad for the OpengL bindings.
- GLFW to manage the window and the OpenGL context.
